This structure represents a Selenium Automation Framework project, adhering to standard Java Maven conventions. Here's a breakdown of each component:

1. Root Directory: JapneetSachdeva1-SeleniumFramework/
This is the base folder containing all the framework components.

2. suites/
Contains TestNG XML suite files that define test execution flow.

Files:
allTestSuite_testNG.xml: Likely includes all test cases in the framework.
smoke_testNG.xml: Focuses on critical "smoke" tests to verify the basic functionality.
regression_testNG.xml: Contains tests that ensure changes donâ€™t break existing functionality.

4. pom.xml
The Maven Project Object Model (POM) file.
Manages dependencies, build lifecycle, and plugins for the project.
Examples of dependencies it may include:
Selenium WebDriver
TestNG
Extent Reports
JSON parsing libraries (e.g., Jackson or Gson)

6. reports/
Contains HTML test execution reports, generated for each test run.
Organized by date:
13_11_2022/ and 14_11_2022/: Subfolders with timestamped HTML reports for specific execution times.

8. README.md
A documentation file in Markdown format.
Typically provides:
Overview of the project.
Setup instructions.
How to run the tests.
Contribution guidelines.

10. src/
This folder holds the main source code and test files.

6.1. main/
Contains the framework's core functionality.

resources/config.properties:

Configuration file for properties like URLs, browser types, and timeout durations.
java/:

base/:

Core classes shared across the framework:
SetupDriver.java: Manages WebDriver setup and teardown.
CustomWaits.java: Contains utility methods for custom explicit/implicit waits.
Commons.java: Commonly used helper functions.
pages/:

Implements the Page Object Model (POM) design.
Subfolders organize pages by category:
products/: Classes representing product-related pages:
LaptopPage.java, DesktopPage.java, etc.
LoginPage.java, HomePage.java, RegisterPage.java, etc.: Represent specific application pages.
utils/:

Utility/helper classes:
ExtentReportHelper.java: Manages Extent Report generation.
ListenerHelper.java: Implements TestNG listeners for logging and reporting.
PropertyReaderHelper.java: Reads and fetches values from config.properties.

6.2. test/
Holds the test cases and related configurations.

testData/:

Stores test data files.
Example:
ecom_login_data.json: Contains login credentials or other test data.
pageTests/:

Test classes for each page:
RegisterPageTests.java, LoginPageTests.java, HomePageTests.java, etc.
Organized into subfolders like ProductTests/ for product-related test cases.
testConfig/:

Contains test configurations.

Example:
BaseTest.java: A base class for test setup and teardown (e.g., WebDriver initialization, loading config).

Key Highlights:

- TestNG and Maven: A well-organized framework leveraging TestNG for test execution and Maven for dependency management.

- Page Object Model (POM): Follows POM design for better maintainability and readability.

- Modular Design: Separate modules for pages, utilities, and tests enhance scalability.

- Reporting: Includes timestamped HTML reports for test execution tracking.

- Reusable Components: Shared code in base and utils promotes reusability and reduces redundancy.

- This framework structure is professional and aligns with industry standards for Selenium-based test automation.
